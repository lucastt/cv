      <p>Online retail platform that sells fashion and beauty products. <br><br>
      <strong>Software Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2022 - Apr 2024)</em> <br>
      There are a few core platform teams in Zalando that develop the underlying infrastructure for all Zalando products. I work in one of this teams, Gateway and Proxy. The gateway and proxy team owns all the edge logic in Zalando, from edge protection to routing and networking at Kubernetes level for all 200+ kubernetes clusters. My contributions within the team are: <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintained an open source reverse proxy called skipper developed in Zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Refactored and improved e2e tests of kubernetes ingress controller for clusters hosted in AWS developed in zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Implemented external hostname based metrics collector to a kubernetes metric adapter, also developed within Zalando and written in Go, this component is responsible to provide metrics to horizontal pod autoscaler in kubernetes, enabling teams to autoscale based on more inteligent and complex metrics.</li>
        <li>Supported teams rolling out Fabric gateway, which is an API gateway built on top of skipper. This API gateway provide to development teams the ability to easily configure all routing, AuthN/AuthX, rate limiting and traffic shaping based on OpenAPI yamls and simple configuration of a Kubernetes CRD. Fabric Gateway was developed in Zalando and written in Go. <br></li>

      </ul>
      <p><strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2021 - Dec 2022)</em> <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved rate limiting and bot traffic protection by:<ul>
        <li>Designing a strategy to improve rate limits in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        <li>Developing several scripts to fetch data and make statistical analysis of rate limits.</li>
        <li>Writing documentation and educational material to enable other engineers to make the same analysis and changes.</li>
        <li>Training of other Engineers to use the tools I created to improve rate limits.</li>
        <li>Design, review and vetting of a new rate limiting middleware using leaky bucket algorithm. <br></li>
        <li>This initiatives reduced incomming bot traffic by more than 50% helping Zalando save many thousands of Euros worth of unecessary infrastructure and outages due to overload in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moderated and participated Post incident analysis (Post mortens). This usualy involves many teams creating an oportunity of a lot of cross team work which improves the platform as a whole but also might improve playbooks and processes.</li>
        <li>Developed a risk register internal tool to track possible and recurrent issues within the whole application ecosystem. This risk register enabled Engineering teams to report risks to high level management (heads and directors) creating cross team colaboration on reliability issues which reduces toil, share knowledge across teams and improves the department ability to act on post mortem action items.</li>
        <li>Improved tracing and adaptive paging solution usage on web experience and checkout services. Reducing the number of false positives for incidents in the department by 13%.</li>
        <li>Participated as 24x7 on call responder rotation with the web experience team within the checkout department. <br></li>

        <p><em>View the <a href="http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/sample_content.html">source of this content</a>.</em></p>

        <p>Let's get the whole "linebreak" thing out of the way. The next paragraph contains two phrases separated by a single newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>The next paragraph has the same phrases, but now they are separated by two spaces and a newline character:</p>

        <p>Roses are red<br><br>
        Violets are blue</p>

        <p>Oh, and one thing I cannot stand is the mangling of words with multiple underscores in them like perform_complicated_task or do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.</p>

        <h2>A bit of the GitHub spice</h2>

        <p>In addition to the changes in the previous section, certain references are auto-linked:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>SHA: be6a8cc1c1ecfe9489fb51e4869af15a13fc2cd2</li>

        </ul>

        <p>These are dangerous goodies though, and we need to make sure email addresses don't get mangled:</p>

        <p>My email addy is <a href="mailto:tom@github.com">tom@github.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>Math is hard, let's go shopping</h2>

        <p>In first grade I learned that 5 &gt; 3 and 2 &lt; 7. Maybe some arrows. 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3. 9 &lt;- 8 &lt;- 7.</p>

        <p>Triangles man! a^2 + b^2 = c^2</p>

        <h2>We all like making lists</h2>

        <p>The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of fruits:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Red Apples</li>
          <li>Purple Grapes</li>
          <li>Green Kiwifruits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Let's get crazy:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>This is a list item with two paragraphs. Lorem ipsum dolor<br>
            sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aliquam hendrerit<br>
            mi posuere lectus.</p>

            <p>Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet<br>
            vitae, risus. Donec sit amet nisl. Aliquam semper ipsum<br>
            sit amet velit.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p>Suspendisse id sem consectetuer libero luctus adipiscing.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>What about some code <strong>in</strong> a list? That's insane, right?</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>In Ruby you can map like this:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map { |x| x.uppercase }</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>In Rails, you can do a shortcut:</p>

            <pre><code>['a', 'b'].map(&amp;:uppercase)</code></pre>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some people seem to like definition lists</p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Lower cost</dt>
          <dd>The new version of this product costs significantly less than the previous one!</dd>
          <dt>Easier to use</dt>
          <dd>We've changed the product so that it's much easier to use!</dd>
        </dl>

        <h2>I am a robot</h2>

        <p>Maybe you want to print <code>robot</code> to the console 1000 times. Why not?</p>

        <pre><code>def robot_invasion
  puts("robot " * 1000)
end
</code></pre>

        <p>You see, that was formatted as code because it's been indented by four spaces.</p>

        <p>How about we throw some angle braces and ampersands in there?</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;div class="footer"&gt;
    &amp;copy; 2004 Foo Corporation
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h2>Set in stone</h2>

        <p>Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:</p>

        <pre>             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.&gt;-(   )-&lt;
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

        <h2>Playing the blame game</h2>

        <p>If you need to blame someone, the best way to do so is by quoting them:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I, at any rate, am convinced that He does not throw dice.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Or perhaps someone a little less eloquent:</p>

        <blockquote>
        <p>I wish you'd have given me this written question ahead of time so I<br>
        could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in<br>
        the midst of this press conference, with all the pressure of trying to<br>
        come up with answer, but it hadn't yet...</p>

        <p>I don't want to sound like<br>
        I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you<br>
        just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet<br>
        as I should be in coming up with one.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Table for two</h2>

        <table>
          <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>ID</th>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Rank</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>1</td>
        <td>Tom Preston-Werner</td>
        <td>Awesome</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2</td>
        <td>Albert Einstein</td>
        <td>Nearly as awesome</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>

        <h2>Crazy linking action</h2>

        <p>I get 10 times more traffic from <a href="http://google.com/" title="Google">Google</a> than from<br>
