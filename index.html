      <p>Food and groceries delivery platform present in 70+ countries. <br><br>
      <strong>Senior Software Engineer (Logistics - Deliveries tribe) </strong> <em>(Jul 2025 - Present)</em> <br></p>
      Deliveries tribe is one of the most core tribes in Delivery Hero. This tribe is responsible for the actual delivery of the the producs sold in our platform, which is the main part of Delivery Hero business. This is also one of the oldest teams in the company and is a great oportunity to work with legacy code and find ways to improve our design.
      <ul>
        <li>Desined the modernisation of the delivery flow architecture that was increasing the risks of incidents and incurring loss of orders to several markets.</li>
        <li>Improved alerts and observability, mainly for the newer features, which improved MTTR and increased confidence on the rollout of new features.</li>
        <li>Worked on Postmortem long and medium term action items since day 1.</li>
        <li>Performed chaos testing of tier 2, 3 and 4 services in production, in preparation for new high-traffic markets.</li>
        <li>Implemented automated phone call agents, so the courier would not have to talk directly to the customer in a case of a problem during a delivery, eliminating language barriers and protecting the customer&#39;s privacy.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented a system to geolocate mall&#39;s entrances. This feature would use geolocation data infered by an ML model to indicate which mall entrance the courier should take in order to get to the restaurant in the most optimal way, reducing delivery time and costs for the company.</li>
        <li>Designed a new form of payment integration via QR codes, so the user could pay for the delivery on their door simply scanning a QR code in the courier app screen.</li>

      There are two main AdTech teams in Delivery hero, one for restaurant and other to the new verticals (groceries, Farmacy etc). I worked within the new verticals until these two were merged, this gave me great oportunity to set the way of how we implemented, design and setup infrastructure of our ads platform from a very initial stage.
      <ul>
        <li>Implemented an A/B testing framework and A/B testing tracking.</li>
        <li>Implemented a ML model monitoring solution so the team could measure ML model accuracy.</li>
        <li>Implemented versioning of machine learning model variables to enable the team to run multiple model versions in parallel.</li>
        <li>Migrated the infrastructure of several AdTech components to support new kubernetes version and the new global development platform implemented in house.</li>
        <li>Improved the latency of AdRanker&#39;s relevance component in 50% by tuning requests and limits parameters to avoid CPU throttling.</li>
        <li>Developed a service responsible to host several different rankers to the different vendor categories taking into account, product popularity, user preferences and promotions.</li>
        <li>Designed a feature cache where we pre-proccess and store information so that machine learning models can consume it with very low latency to rank products for the product catalog in real time.</li>

      <strong>Software Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2022 - Apr 2024)</em> <br>
      There are a few core platform teams in Zalando that develop the underlying infrastructure for all Zalando products. I work in one of this teams, Gateway and Proxy. The gateway and proxy team owns all the edge logic in Zalando, from edge protection to routing and networking at Kubernetes level for all 200+ kubernetes clusters. My contributions within the team are: <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintained an open source reverse proxy called skipper developed in Zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Refactored and improved e2e tests of kubernetes ingress controller for clusters hosted in AWS developed in zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Implemented external hostname based metrics collector to a kubernetes metric adapter, also developed within Zalando and written in Go, this component is responsible to provide metrics to horizontal pod autoscaler in kubernetes, enabling teams to autoscale based on more inteligent and complex metrics.</li>
        <li>Supported teams rolling out Fabric gateway, which is an API gateway built on top of skipper. This API gateway provide to development teams the ability to easily configure all routing, AuthN/AuthX, rate limiting and traffic shaping based on OpenAPI yamls and simple configuration of a Kubernetes CRD. Fabric Gateway was developed in Zalando and written in Go. <br></li>

      <p><strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2021 - Dec 2022)</em> <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved rate limiting and bot traffic protection by:<ul>
        <li>Designing a strategy to improve rate limits in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        <li>Developing several scripts to fetch data and make statistical analysis of rate limits.</li>
        <li>Writing documentation and educational material to enable other engineers to make the same analysis and changes.</li>
        <li>Training of other Engineers to use the tools I created to improve rate limits.</li>
        <li>Design, review and vetting of a new rate limiting middleware using leaky bucket algorithm. <br></li>
        <li>This initiatives reduced incomming bot traffic by more than 50% helping Zalando save many thousands of Euros worth of unecessary infrastructure and outages due to overload in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moderated and participated Post incident analysis (Post mortens). This usualy involves many teams creating an oportunity of a lot of cross team work which improves the platform as a whole but also might improve playbooks and processes.</li>
        <li>Developed a risk register internal tool to track possible and recurrent issues within the whole application ecosystem. This risk register enabled Engineering teams to report risks to high level management (heads and directors) creating cross team colaboration on reliability issues which reduces toil, share knowledge across teams and improves the department ability to act on post mortem action items.</li>
        <li>Improved tracing and adaptive paging solution usage on web experience and checkout services. Reducing the number of false positives for incidents in the department by 13%.</li>
        <li>Participated as 24x7 on call responder rotation with the web experience team within the checkout department. <br></li>
