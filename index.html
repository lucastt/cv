      <p>Online retail platform that sells fashion and beauty products. <br><br>
      <strong>Software Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2022 - Apr 2024)</em> <br>
      There are a few core platform teams in Zalando that develop the underlying infrastructure for all Zalando products. I work in one of this teams, Gateway and Proxy. The gateway and proxy team owns all the edge logic in Zalando, from edge protection to routing and networking at Kubernetes level for all 200+ kubernetes clusters. My contributions within the team are: <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintained an open source reverse proxy called skipper developed in Zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Refactored and improved e2e tests of kubernetes ingress controller for clusters hosted in AWS developed in zalando and written in Go.</li>
        <li>Implemented external hostname based metrics collector to a kubernetes metric adapter, also developed within Zalando and written in Go, this component is responsible to provide metrics to horizontal pod autoscaler in kubernetes, enabling teams to autoscale based on more inteligent and complex metrics.</li>
        <li>Supported teams rolling out Fabric gateway, which is an API gateway built on top of skipper. This API gateway provide to development teams the ability to easily configure all routing, AuthN/AuthX, rate limiting and traffic shaping based on OpenAPI yamls and simple configuration of a Kubernetes CRD. Fabric Gateway was developed in Zalando and written in Go. <br></li>

      <p><strong>Site Reliability Engineer</strong> <em>(Dec 2021 - Dec 2022)</em> <br></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved rate limiting and bot traffic protection by:<ul>
        <li>Designing a strategy to improve rate limits in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        <li>Developing several scripts to fetch data and make statistical analysis of rate limits.</li>
        <li>Writing documentation and educational material to enable other engineers to make the same analysis and changes.</li>
        <li>Training of other Engineers to use the tools I created to improve rate limits.</li>
        <li>Design, review and vetting of a new rate limiting middleware using leaky bucket algorithm. <br></li>
        <li>This initiatives reduced incomming bot traffic by more than 50% helping Zalando save many thousands of Euros worth of unecessary infrastructure and outages due to overload in cart and checkout flows.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Moderated and participated Post incident analysis (Post mortens). This usualy involves many teams creating an oportunity of a lot of cross team work which improves the platform as a whole but also might improve playbooks and processes.</li>
        <li>Developed a risk register internal tool to track possible and recurrent issues within the whole application ecosystem. This risk register enabled Engineering teams to report risks to high level management (heads and directors) creating cross team colaboration on reliability issues which reduces toil, share knowledge across teams and improves the department ability to act on post mortem action items.</li>
        <li>Improved tracing and adaptive paging solution usage on web experience and checkout services. Reducing the number of false positives for incidents in the department by 13%.</li>
        <li>Participated as 24x7 on call responder rotation with the web experience team within the checkout department. <br></li>
